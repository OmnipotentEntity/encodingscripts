This is just stupid bullshit right now, nothing big and fancy.

Pushing to github and actually managing the changes because it's annoying me that I change things without keeping a record

Some Notes
==========

The only file you should care about, and indeed the only file I use is assemble-mp4-deldup.sh

Here's what you need to make it work:

A subtitle file that mplayer can understand saved to the location indicated in SUBTITLEOPTS
A logo video located in the place indicated in LOGO
A silent audio file as long as your logo video located in the place indicated in SILENCE

A copy of x264, compiled for 8-bit video encoding, http://wiki.videolan.org/Git
A copy of x264, compiled for 10-bit video encoding
A copy of dedup, http://tasvideos.org/EncodingGuide/DedupC.html
A copy of tasblend (command line filter version), http://tasvideos.org/EncodingGuide/TASBlend.html
A copy of the Nero AacEncoder for linux, http://www.nero.com/enu/company/about-nero/nero-aac-codec.php
A copy of MP4Box, SVN: https://gpac.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gpac

All of these you can use standalone with the exception of MP4Box, which, vexingly, must be installed after compilation.
Download and compile all of the different programs, set up the paths.  And set up your subtitles.

Then call the script as follows:

./assemble-mp4-deldup.sh FPS NativeXRes NativeYRes LogoName SilenceName AviParts

Example for Gens dumps
./assemble-mp4-deldup.sh 60 320 240 gens gensilencestd dumpA.avi dumpB.avi dumbC.avi

LogoName and SilenceName are both shortened forms of the parameters saves some typing, feel free to edit or whatever
